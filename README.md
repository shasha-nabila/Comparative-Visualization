# Project Overview
This repository contains the Interactive Dashboard and the Final Report for the Information Visualization coursework (COMP3736) at the University of Leeds. The project investigates the effectiveness of scatterplots vs. heatmaps in extremum detection tasks, focusing on how users interpret pupil absence rates across a school year.

# Interactive Dashboard
The interactive dashboard was developed using **Python (Dash & Plotly)** to conduct the experiment and collect user interaction data. Participants were presented with heatmaps and scatterplots to identify maximum and minimum values.
